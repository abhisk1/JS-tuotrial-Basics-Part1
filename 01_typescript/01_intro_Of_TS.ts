/* 
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language developed by Microsoft. 

=>TypeScript is used to catch errors before you run the code. It helps to improve the quality of code and makes it easier to maintain.



=> TS = It's a superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes all of JavaScript's functionality and adds additional features  and it adds optional static typing to the language.
 */



/* ** why we use or benefits of TS**

=> TypeScript allows developers to use modern JavaScript features and provides tools for large-scale application development.

=> This helps developers to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values, enabling early error detection during development and improving code maintainability.

**key points:
Static typing
Early error detection
Code safety
Better maintainability
Scales better for large projects
 */

// => TypeScript code compiles down to JavaScript, which can then be run in any JavaScript environment, such as browsers or Node.js.



/*  **Uses of TS**
=> Early Error Detection: Compile-time checks reduce runtime errors, which leads to more reliable applications

=> Improved Code Maintainability: With type annotations, itâ€™s easier to understand, refactor, and maintain large codebases.
(type annotations: they are used to specify the type of a variable, function parameter, or return value in TypeScript.)

**key points:
Used in both frontend and backend development
